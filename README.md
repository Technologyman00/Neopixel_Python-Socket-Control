# Neopixel_Python-Socket-Control

Neopixel Controlled by Python Socket Server on Raspberry Pi

Hi! This is a project for My FRC team where we have a Neopixel Light Controlled by a RPI that runs a Python Socket Server to get the Commands on what Color to output this is used because the RPI does not have a I2C Slave Driver and PWM input isnt perfect. So we use a Socket Server on the RPI to recieve info from the Client on the Driverstation using the open ports allowed on the Field system or the FMS.

You should use the Release Folder if you plan on using this program 
  Note: Takes time to connect usually is not instant which is why the Client Loops Trys.
  
The Old-Version Folder is for the Progress of the Program (May or Maynot be Stable)
